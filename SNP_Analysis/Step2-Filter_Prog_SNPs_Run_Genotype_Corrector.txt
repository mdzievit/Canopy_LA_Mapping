First need to take the filtered SNPs from Step 1 script and use those with vcfTools to filter the progeny SNP data. These vcf files are too large and would need to be requested from the authors.

Next step would be to run the genotype corrector python pipeline (see paper for more details) with the filtered progeny data that is converted into the 
AB formart the genotype corrector needs. There is a python script called VCF_to_AB.py that will do that.

Unfortunately, I was not able to recover the exact commands that went from filtering progeny SNPs, formatting to AB format, and then running genotype corrector.

The output of genotype corrector is used for the next step.
